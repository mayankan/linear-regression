# Simple Linear Regression

## There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:

### 1) Import the packages and classes you need.
### 2) Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.
### 3) Calculate slope and y_intercept for the given data.
### 4) Predict the values on given data using the formulae y=mx+c.
### 5) Check the results of model predictions to know whether the model is accurate.
